      <h1 class="title">Charity Donations</h1>
      <p>Instead of flowers we would like to suggest people make a donation to one of the following charities</p>
      <h2>Marie Curie</h2>
      <p>We are so grateful to <em>Marie Curie</em> for their support and making sure their patients are as 
        comfortable and peaceful as possible when the end came.
      </p>
      <a class="button" target="_blank" rel=”noopener” href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/">Donate to Marie Curie</a>
      <h2>Make a Wish</h2>
      <p><em>Make A Wish</em>'s goal of giving joy to children during a terrible time is something that would be a fitting tribute.</p>
